Game of life
Alive cells have a color (depending on the player that spawned it)
Further cells creations follow the rule:
	If all parents are non-players, the cell is non-player
	If at least one parent is player1 and none is player2, the cell is player1
	If at least one parent is player1 and at least one parent is player2, the cell is non-player
Every turn a player can change ANY cell
Start with a random grid
Variable size and density
If both players choose the same cell twice in a row => DRAW
WIN CONDITION:
	After n generations, the player with the most cells win
OR
	Whenever a player has less than n cells, they lose and their opponent wins
